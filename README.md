# TypeScript

---

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript so it does include all JS features + new features. Its value shines when we deal with larger project where type saftey matters, so basicly it allow us to **add data types** to js code.

## 1. Static Typing

```
  const x = 0; === const x:number = 0;
  x = "Bahaa"; <- ❌
```

it can be a number, string, array, object, any, null, undifined etc..
meaning that if you want to re-assign a value you'll get an error.
